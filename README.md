# Karnataka-Lake-Project
Developed an advanced website for the Karnataka Data Lake project, to generate interactive heatmaps for SDG-based policy insights. 
This supported digital empowerment and sustainable development in live government projects with tangible social impact. Technologies used are web programming/designing, HTML embedding, BASH, Tableau, and WordPress. Our team collaborated consistently, to evaluate district-level SDG indicators in Karnataka.

1.	Overall objective of the Project:
The project aims to utilize five years of statistical Open Data from the Government of Karnataka, covering various districts across the state. The goal is to convert this data into a queryable format aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By making this dataset queryable, we can derive valuable insights to support policymaking and contribute to the effective achievement of the SDGs.
2.	A brief introduction of the project you are working in:
My primary responsibility in this project is to develop a webpage that provides a summary of the project through various menus. As part of this development, my goal was to create interactive heat maps on SDGs and Departments administratives. This task is divided into SDGs and Departments.
a.	Over SDGs:  The task here is to create interactive heat maps for the overall SDGs for each of the past five years for Karnataka districts. These heat maps allow for the comparison of each SDG across different districts over the years, generating detailed visualizations for each SDG in every district.
b.	Over Departments:  The task is to create interactive heat maps showcasing the overall Department SDGs for each of the past five years across Karnataka's districts. These heat maps will enable visualization of all the department SDGs for each district by hovering over the respective districts on the Karnataka map. This functionality will generate detailed visualizations of all departmental SDGs for every district over the years.

What stage was the project before you started:
The webpage had the SDG Aligned Data Browser, Semantic Mapper, and KAG Browser
Upgrades or additions that you performed:
•	Developed a user-friendly web page, integrating various menus including Home, Research Team, Project, Data, Interactive Map, Browser, FAQ, and Contact. The content for the SDG Aligned Data Browser, Semantic Mapper, and KAG Browser was structured as submenus under the Browser menu. 
•	Each menu's content was meticulously drafted and integrated into the web page.
•	Advanced heat maps, addressing the requirements outlined in Point 2 (a & b), were developed using Tableau and subsequently published to Tableau Public.
•	These dynamic reports were then embedded into the web page under the Interactive Map menu, enhancing data visualization capabilities.
•	The web page underwent continuous enhancements and refinements over time, to improve functionality and user experience.
